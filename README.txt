	Block/Un-Block User to place bid: Admin can now block any registered user to place their bid. If blocked then user will not be able to place bid and will get an alert message. This will help auctioneers to block users who win but dont pay final bid amount.

	Instant Bidding: Admin gets a configuration under Auction Settings which when enabled will place bid instantly using AJAX based requests without page refresh. 

	Show Countdown timer on shop page: Admin gets a new configuration to enable timer for auction products on shop page. Configuration is under: Auction->Settings->Display Settings Tab -> Shop Page Setting -> Enable/Disable countdown on Shop(Product loop) Page)

	Hide "Product Condition" field on Auction detail page: New configuration has been added under Settings > Display Settings to hide this field. 

2. Improvement:

	Plugin Menu: We have organized plugin menu in better way so that it is more convenient for admin to access all settings and information in it.

	Anti-Sniping/Soft Close: We have added two options for this feature. One option will recursively extend expiration time if bids are placed during a specific time interval. Second option will extend expiration only once and will send email to all bidders intimating this extension. Admin can now choose what behavior they want.

	Add Auction Product form now has options to choose bidding, buy now or both.

	Multiple checkout option for users: If any user has won multiple auction products, he/she had to individually click "Pay Now" link under their My Accounts > Auctions > Won Bids to checkout that product and pay. Now, plugin offers a multiple check out option which will add all their won products to their WooCommerce's checkout page and they can pay for them together. 

	We have now renamed "Scheduled", "Pending" words to "Future" so that it is easier for admin to understand future auctions.

3. Fix:

	Shop page was not listing auctions if admin edited any auction. This bug appeared due to wrong query implementation but is now fixed.

	Multiple warnings with the plugin has been fixed.
